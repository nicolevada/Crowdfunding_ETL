# Crowdfunding_ETL
This is a Jupyter Notebook file for the ETL Mini-Project. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) process for a dataset.

To begin, the notebook starts with importing necessary libraries such as Pandas and NumPy. Then, it reads in the dataset from a CSV file using the Pandas library.

Next, the data is cleaned and transformed. The column names are standardized, the data types are converted, and unnecessary columns are dropped. Additionally, null values are handled and any duplicates are removed.

Finally, the transformed data is loaded into a new database table using SQLalchemy. The connection details for the database are defined at the beginning of the notebook.

Overall, this notebook provides a step-by-step guide for implementing the ETL process for a dataset using Python and SQLalchemy.

Thank you for checking out this project!
